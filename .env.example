# Convex Site URL (Better Auth HTTP router host)
# Typically one port higher than VITE_CONVEX_URL when running locally
# Example: if VITE_CONVEX_URL is :3210, use :3211 here
VITE_CONVEX_SITE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3211

# Frontend app base URL (used by Better Auth crossDomain/SameSite handling)
VITE_APP_URL=http://localhost:5173

# Server-side Better Auth base (Convex-side) — convex/auth.ts reads SITE_URL first,
# then falls back to VITE_APP_URL. Set this to your Convex Site URL for clarity.
